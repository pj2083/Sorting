# Sorting

## Stable Algorithm 
  A Stable Sort is one which preserves the original order of input set, where the comparison algorithm does not distinguish between two or more items. 
  A Stable Sort will guarantee that the original order of data having the same rank is preserved in the output.
  
## Example 
  Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Bubble Sort 
 ## Non Example
   Quick Sort, Heap Sort
   
 ## Note
  1. Bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort are in-place sorting algorithms. Because only swapping of the element in the input array is required.
  2. Bubble sort and insertion sort can be applying as stable algorithms but selection sort cannot (without significant modifications).
  3. Merge sort is a stable algorithm but not an in-place algorithm. It requires extra array storage.
  4. Quicksort is not stable but is an in-place algorithm.
  5. Heap sort is an in-place algorithm but is not stable.
